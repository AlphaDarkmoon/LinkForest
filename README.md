## Latest Version: [v1.0]()

## Description

LinkForest is a beautifully designed LinkTree page crafted using Bootstrap 5, incorporating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

You can utilize this platform to organize all your links in one centralized location. It's versatile and can be effectively used across various platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, or any other social media platform.

To customize LinkForest according to your specific needs, follow the [Docs]() (Documentation) where you'll find guidance on modifying the layout and content.

Furthermore, the documentation will educate you on how to host any static website for free.

- Understanding Static Websites: A static website is a type of website that delivers content exactly as it is stored to the user's web browser. The content is fixed and remains the same regardless of who is accessing the website or when they access it. It's typically written in HTML and CSS, and sometimes includes a bit of JavaScript for interactivity, but the content doesn't change dynamically.
  - some common examples are resume websites, portfolio websites, brochure websites, one-off landing pages, and other informational or read-only sites.

# Documentation

There is a proper Documentation that will teach you how to edit and update the Website as per your needs and requirements.
